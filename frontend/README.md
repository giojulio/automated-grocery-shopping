<h1><b>🛒Shopper.com 2022🛒</b></h1>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<p>🗺️ This project allows registered users to create a grocery shopping list with a scheduled delivery date. Users may update the list as they like, unless the desired product runs out of stock. All of the communication is made through an API Rest, developed by the author as well. </p>
